## Problem Statement
Space nerds need their historical space data fix but the data needs to be more fun to access. Developing the "Space Nerds Database" (SNDB) web tool is intended to help nerds everywhere appreciate the world's invested legacy in rocketry and human space travel.

## Features
- The tool's home page offers links to full listings of either spacecraft or launches. The menu lets nerds select detailed search fields for 'Spacecraft' families or 'Pad' histories.
- When typing the first few letters of either option a selectable button label appears.
- Selecting 'spacecraft' displays a list of families such as Mercury, Gemini, Soyuz.
- Typing a family's first few letters then selecting its label displays matching spacecraft, details, and images on cards selectable for more detail.
- Selecting the 'Pads' menu option offers a list of pad location details.
